Notes on various subjects

# Quantum information
Lecture notes for [IF Summer School for Young Physicists 2023](https://www.if.nu.ac.th/2023-if-summer-school/), Naresuan University, covering 
* An invitation to Shannon theory 
* Linear algebra in the bra-ket notation, and a quick rundown of the quantum formalism in finite-dimensional spaces 
* Communication using ebits (superdense coding, teleportation with perhaps an unusual proof), EPR argument, and the CHSH inequality via a nonlocal game

# Lie groups
A very condensed and incomplete summary of the [book by Kirillov Jr.](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~kirillov/liegroups/liegroups.pdf), mostly focus on what confused me before by reading e.g. Fulton and Harris.

# Chern-Simons theory
My final term paper on Chern-Simons topological quantum field theories for PHYS253 Quantum Field Theory taught by Prof. Rouzbeh Allahverdi.
