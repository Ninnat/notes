Notes on various subjects

# lie_groups
A very condensed and incomplete summary of the [book by Kirillov Jr.](https://www.math.stonybrook.edu/~kirillov/liegroups/liegroups.pdf), mostly focus on what confused me before by reading e.g. Fulton and Harris.

# chern-simons
My final term paper on Chern-Simons topological quantum field theories for PHYS253 Quantum Field Theory taught by Prof. Rouzbeh Allahverdi.

# invitation to quantum information
Part 1/2 of quantum information as a part of IF Summer School 2023, Naresuan University. The notes cover 
* An invitation to Shannon theory 
* Linear algebra in the bra-ket notation and a quick rundown of the quantum formalism in finite-dimensional spaces 
* Communication using ebits (superdense coding, teleportation with an unusual proof), EPR argument, and the CHSH inequality using a nonlocal game
